notes and stuff to keep track of

Proposed formula:

	payment = (i*PV)/(1-(1+i)^-n)

		PV = present value of loan (loan amount)
		i = period interest rate expressed as a decimal
		n = number of loan payments
		
	payments toward interest = P*(i/12)
	
		P = principal remaining
		i = period interest rate expressed as a decimal
		
	payment toward principal = PAY - IP
	
		PAY = total payment amount
		IP  = payment towards interest


Key data to collect and return:
	- Customer's Name
	- Name of mortgage type
	- Mortgage Amount
	- Downpayment amount/%
	- interest rate
	- Duration (open field)
	- Additional Payments per Month/year
		- Show amount of interest saved
		- Show shortening in length of loan
		
Data to be created and returned:
	- Ammortization Table
	- Payment Amount
		- Interest Amount
		- Principal Amount
		- Remaining Principal
		
		
Proposed Structure:
	Mortgage object:
		- length of loan/remaining
		- Name of customer
		- Balance (initial/current)
		- down payment
			detect if entered as a percent or dollar number (nobody has a down payment of $100 or less, right?)
			store and calculate either the percentage of dollar amount based on what is not entered
		- Interest Rate

Implemented the amortization calculation code, which I believe is supposed to be the most difficult part of this?
Also implemented the first test, which would make sure that the caclulated values don't change anymore.
